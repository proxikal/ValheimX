# ValheimX
> Created by Joshua Cleland (Proxy)  
> Current Version: **Early Access**
  
**100% Customizable** Valheim Mod Builder with __**no coding experience**__ required!!  
Built-in C# Compiler to allow **experienced users** to customize their mods even more!  
Build your own plugin for ValheimX and share it with others!

## How this works
Open ValheimX: Name your project & Create!  
Add the Features you want your mod to have  
Add\Remove Chat Commands, Smelter Recipes, Actions Etc..
Save your project for later editing
And then click Build Project!  
Literally **NO CODING REQUIRED**!!   
  
  
   
  
  
## Chat Bot
- Add chat commands and give them functionality using our built in **Action Keys**  
- For Example if you add `{skipnight}` to your chat command response  
- Your mod will then proceed to skip to morning when the command has been sent!  
- Chat Admin System with mute\kick\ban capabilities.
  

## Smelter Recipes
- Have the ability to add/remove recipes for the smelter, change fuel amount & Cook times!  
  

## Trader Items
- Add\Remove items from the trader, along with giving a range of prices to shuffle through  
- instead of an item having a stable price, you can switch it to dynamic and set the range!  
  

## Features
- Click to add or remove Features! You have control of what your mod can do!  
- Developers have the ability to build their own features as well!  
  

## Plugins
- Very easy Plugin Framework to allow manipulation of ValheimX!  
- Add to Features and manipulate the Compiler Tasks.  
- Ability to even replace or add to current system plugins such as Smelter Recipes & Chat Bot.  
  
Developers have the option to build their plugin with a form or not  
either is acceptable and instructions will be given at a later time.
