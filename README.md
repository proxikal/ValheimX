## How this works
ValheimX will do all the heavy work for you! all you have to do is pick your features  
Add all of the extras in that you want, rather it be extra smelter recipes  
Chat bot options, and sooo much more. the options are truly limitless..  
**Plugins** and **Features** can be added and built by anyone and added to ValheimX  
We'll work on a public repository for plugins and features in the future.  
For now, We'll probably post any new plugins and features here on Github!  
  
  
## Chat bots, Weapon trainers and much more!
> You'll have the ability to add functions to your mod such as Weapon trainers, Auto eat food when hungry, Auto Pickup and Farm  
> Along with so much more! all within a few clicks.


## Smelter Recipes
> Have the ability to add/remove recipes for the smelter, along with some other really neat functions!!  

  
## Built in C# Compiler
> Kernal version: 0.0.1a  
If you have the basic understanding of C# or programming in general, using our Built in Compiler will be intuitive.  
All of the tools required to build a mod for Valheim has already been imported into ValheimX.  
All you have to do is add the Prefix or Postfix class to the events system and your code will execute once the event has triggered.    
**Choose your Editor** : ValheimX doesn't have a built in IDE. so you will need to code in your favorite text editor  
And then copy the snippets into ValheimX. We're working on a built in text editor for code, however we could never compete with  
Sublime Text, VCode, Etc...
