## How this works
Create a new Project, Make sure to name your mod, add the author name and version.  
Now, Decide if your mod will be Client Side, Server Side or Both (Both is default).  
Once you've added all your features and events Save your project.  
Build your mod using the Compiler section. This will let you know of any errors and the overall status of the build.  
Once the DLL has been built, it will automatically be placed in the valheim BepInEx plugins folder.  
If you don't jave BepInEx Pack for valheim installed, don't worry. ValheimX will automatically install on build. 

  
## Chat bots, Weapon trainers and much more!
> You'll have the ability to add functions to your mod such as Weapon trainers, Auto eat food when hungry, Auto Pickup and Farm  
> Along with so much more! all within a few clicks.


## Smelter Recipes
> Have the ability to add/remove recipes for the smelter, along with some other really neat functions!!  

  
## Built in C# Compiler
> Kernal version: 0.0.1a  
If you have the basic understanding of C# or programming in general, using our Built in Compiler will be intuitive.  
All of the tools required to build a mod for Valheim has already been imported into ValheimX.  
All you have to do is add the Prefix or Postfix class to the events system and your code will execute once the event has triggered.    
**Choose your Editor** : ValheimX doesn't have a built in IDE. so you will need to code in your favorite text editor  
And then copy the snippets into ValheimX. We're working on a built in text editor for code, however we could never compete with  
Sublime Text, VCode, Etc...
