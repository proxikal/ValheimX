## How this works
Everything will be very simple and explained in ValheimX along with many tutorials etc.  
However, the system should be very intuitive after a few short tutorials as the main purpose is ease of use.  

## Chat bots, Weapon trainers and much more!
> You'll have the ability to add functions to your mod such as Weapon trainers, Auto eat food when hungry, Auto Pickup and Farm  
> Along with so much more! all within a few clicks.


## Smelter Recipes
> Have the ability to add/remove recipes for the smelter, along with some other really neat functions!!  

  
## Built in C# Compiler
> Kernal version: 0.0.1a  
If you have the basic understanding of C# or programming in general, using our Built in Compiler will be intuitive.  
All of the tools required to build a mod for Valheim has already been imported into ValheimX.  
All you have to do is add the Prefix or Postfix class to the events system and your code will execute once the event has triggered.    
**Choose your Editor** : ValheimX doesn't have a built in IDE. so you will need to code in your favorite text editor  
And then copy the snippets into ValheimX. We're working on a built in text editor for code, however we could never compete with  
Sublime Text, VCode, Etc...
