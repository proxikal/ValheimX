## How this works
The way ValheimX works is unique. It's basically A Compiler
specifically built for Valheim modding in mind.  
Instead of editing a config file of an already built DLL (Mod)  
ValheimX instead builds your mod in real time!  
Just click to add features and services and click Build!  
Literally **NO CODING REQUIRED**!!  
That means __YOUR__ mod. Not someone elses!  
Which also means __YOUR__ imagination. Not someone elses.  
  
  
   
  
  
## Chat bots, Weapon trainers and more!
> You'll have the ability to add functions to your mod such as Weapon trainers, Auto eat food when hungry, Auto Pickup and Farm  
> Along with so much more! all within a few clicks.


## Smelter Recipes
> Have the ability to add/remove recipes for the smelter, along with some other really neat functions!!  

  
## Features
One of the main goals of ValheimX is to allow 100% customization.  
If you guys have ever used my Discord bot Echo (2015-2020) you'll know  
I thrive off the ability to customize EVERYTHING! and so far everyone agrees.  
With that in mind, Anyone with the knowledge of C# will have the ability to make features.  
And share them with others. Features are fully dynamic and can be built and configured at the code level.  

## Plugins
As above, Customization!!! This option will allow developers the ability to add features without showing the code.  
As features are listed in a directory and called upon and can be seen\edited by anyone. The plugins method injects  
the features internally and will leave no possible way of anyone seeing your code or editing it.  
Plugins will also give you the ability to customize in-app services such as the Chat Bot, Smelter Recipes etc..  

Developers have the option to build their plugin with a form or not, either is acceptable and instructions will be given  
at a later time.  
  
## Built in C# Compiler
> Kernal version: 0.0.1a  
If you have the basic understanding of C# or programming in general, using our Built in Compiler will be intuitive.  
All of the tools required to build a mod for Valheim has already been imported into ValheimX.  
All you have to do is add the Prefix or Postfix class to the events system and your code will execute once the event has triggered.    
**Choose your Editor** : ValheimX doesn't have a built in IDE. so you will need to code in your favorite text editor  
And then copy the snippets into ValheimX. We're working on a built in text editor for code, however we could never compete with  
Sublime Text, VCode, Etc...
